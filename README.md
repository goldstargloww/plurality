# plurality, except files

<ins>**this is a heavy work in progress! feel free to suggest changes or make contributions yourself**</ins>

i got bored and got annoyed with how so many tools for plurality (such as simply plural or pluralkit) only allow you to do so much

i understand *why*, but i'd ultimately like something easier to edit while allowing for as much customizability and flexibility as you'd like, so i impulsively decided to turn myself into a json file. i am so good at making decisions-

this may end up ultimately turning into its own file format or something, but right now, it's just a single json file which you can use for those in your system to keep track of information, and can store any information you want, pretty much

this is created from a LIOMist perspective, meaning it's made with diversity in plurality and its functions in mind. if you're a sysmedicalist, you probably won't like the sort of options in here, and although i'd prefer you to not use this, i can't and won't try to stop you. just please be respectful about it.
